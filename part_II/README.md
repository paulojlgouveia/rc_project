## Description
The goal of this project is to understand what Zero-Determinant Strategies are, what makes them different from other strategies, and how well they perform. <br>
Our focus is on the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma and more specifically on trying to understand how well do Zero-Determinant Strategies fare in evolutionary scenarios where players are allowed to evolve. <br>
In order to test their performance we create a tournament similar to Axelrod’s Tournaments,using the ”Axelrod” python library.
